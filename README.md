# PGM Public Maps

:european_castle: Publicly downloadable maps created for the open-source [PGM plugins](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM).

This repository has the purpose of providing new and classic PGM maps that have been designed and tested on the maintained [PGMDev](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) version of the classic Pvp Game Manager plugins from the former Overcast Network. Our other repositories of maps for PGM are mostly designed for older and now unmaintained versions of this plugin and may not work as intended.

All maps can be downloaded from the [PGM Collection](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/pgm) on our website.

Please refer to the individual map folders for license details. For maps without a license, please seek additional permissions from the original authors. For more information on map use and acquisition, refer to our [map policy](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/policies/maps).

Contributing
-----------------

### **For map authors:**  
If you have a map that is designed for use with PGM and would like to add it to our collections, please get in contact with one of our [managers](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/staff) through Discord.

### **For contributors:**  
Before adding a new map, ensure that you can answer **all** the following questions with "yes".

- Does the folder name match the slug entered into the corresponding maps data file?
- Is the XML included and properly formatted (4 spaces, no tabs, etc)?
- Is the `map.png` included, have the correct dimensions (290 x 246), and not distorted?
- Has the map been correctly pruned?

If a map has already been added, we will only accept alternate versions of it if it is different enough from the existing version. When making a pull request, please clearly outline what makes your version different.

Notice
-----------------

If your map has been added to this repository without permission, or you no longer want it publicly available, please contact one of our [managers](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/staff) through Discord and we will remove the contect as soon as possible.
